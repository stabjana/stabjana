#### [Multi-Tenancy Storage & Booking App – “Harakka”](https://github.com/con2/harakka)
**Role:** Product Owner · Team Lead · Full-Stack Developer  
**Tech Stack:** TypeScript · React · Node.js · Supabase · PostgreSQL · TailwindCSS  

As part of our development team I contributed as a **full stack developer** to the **Harakka full-stack storage and booking application**, developed within the [con2](https://github.com/con2) organization.
My responsibilities included:
- Acting as **Product owner and Scrum Master**, I did Sprint planning, set priorities and I made sure that we incorporated all customers feedback.
- I implemented a lot of **backend APIs** (Node.js and supabase) -> they have been worked on continuously afterwards to fit multi tenancy and customers expectations.
- Bug reports and Bugfix tracking (also bug fixing)
- Reviewing Pull Requests and making sure we have all documentation ready

```js
let happyPlace = "coding";
console.log(`I love ${happyPlace}.`);
```
