### Stefanie Jana :wave:

Hi, I’m Steffi, a former archaeologist and now a full-stack developer.  
I recently finished my studies at Business College Helsinki and I am currently working in an internship at Nutriliser, where our team is building an MVP for a food app using React Native, Python and Supabase.  
I love learning, building things and turning ideas into real apps and working with people.

Here on my GitHub you can find my study projects, group work and our final internship project built together with **con2**.

#### [Multi-Tenancy Storage & Booking App – “Harakka”](https://github.com/con2/harakka) - Link
(unfortunately it if offline until our customers are deploying it again)

**Role:** Full-Stack Developer · Product Owner · Team Lead  
**Tech Stack:** TypeScript · React · Node.js · Supabase · PostgreSQL · TailwindCSS

During our internship, I worked as a part of a small, self-organised development team. We built a full-stack multi-tenant booking app for a real customer. I contributed technically and also in a product-oriented role.

**My main responsibilities:**
- Acting as *Product Owner / Scrum Master* with sprint planning, prioritizing and customer communication  
- Designing and implementing several backend APIs (Node.js + Supabase) 
- Debugging, bug reports and bug fixing  
- Reviewing pull requests and supporting the team with documentation and coordination  

The project gave me a real experience with autonomy, ownership and how to deliver a production-level app with my team.

```ts
const happyPlace = "coding";
console.log(`I love ${happyPlace}.`);
